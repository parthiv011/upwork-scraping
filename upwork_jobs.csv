These aren’t clean, linear builds. They’re iterative, sometimes chaotic, often AI-generated starting points that need real engineering insight to go the final mile. The core of the job is taking Replit-based projects—partially working, loosely structured—and completing them for real-world usability. What you'll be doing: Taking Replit projects from 50% to shipped: debugging, refactoring, and wiring together loose ends Integrating APIs and services: OpenAI, Pinecone, Notion, Stripe, and others Handling auth, credentials, and environment setup to make APIs work securely and consistently Deploying to live environments: Replit hosting when possible, Vercel/Heroku/custom servers when needed Making practical decisions on structure, packages, and architecture to support fast iteration Working with AI assistance (Replit AI, Copilot, etc.) to speed up build cycles without depending on them blindly Technical context: Most builds lean on modern JavaScript (Node.js, Express, React) and Python (Flask, FastAPI) depending on the use case. There’s a lot of API stitching, utility logic, async workflows, and figuring out what’s broken in a semi-working project scaffold. You should be comfortable picking up unfamiliar code, figuring out what it should do, and getting it there quickly. Who this is for: You like working inside flexible, AI-enabled dev environments like Replit You know how to make AI-generated code functional, not just passable You don’t get stuck in framework wars—React, Flask, vanilla JS, it all depends on the job You think in terms of usability, not just syntax. You care whether it works and makes sense You enjoy deploying small projects that solve real problems, not just writing boilerplate This is ""vibe coding"" with a real finish line—fast, messy, creative, technical, and deployed. Let’s build, fix, and launch some great stuff."

Project Overview: Our portal allows users to upload video files (specifically .MOV format), which are then converted to .MP4 via backend processes. The system is deployed using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services including Cloud Run, and managed using PM2 for process management. The problem arises when users upload large .MOV files (300MB+), and multiple files get queued. The backend process responsible for the video conversion crashes—specifically, the PM2 namespace crashes and fails to automatically recover. We're currently restarting the process manually via sudo pm2 start 8, which is not scalable or sustainable. We need someone to: * Investigate and resolve why PM2 crashes under load * Optimize the video conversion process for better memory and CPU management * Implement auto-restart or recovery mechanisms for the PM2 process * Suggest and implement improvements in how our containers scale under heavy loads * Ensure overall system reliability and uptime * Tech Stack / Tools Involved: * Google Cloud Platform (GCP) * Cloud Run * Cloud Storage * PM2 (Process Manager) * FFmpeg (or equivalent for video conversion) * Node.js (Backend service, assuming from PM2 usage) * Docker / Containerization * Linux / Shell scripting What We're Looking For: - Proven experience with GCP and containerized environments (Cloud Run especially) - Deep understanding of PM2, process monitoring, and auto-recovery strategies - Strong knowledge of FFmpeg or video processing tools - Experience optimizing performance for file-heavy, CPU-intensive applications - Familiarity with container scaling, memory limits, and process isolation - Ability to work independently and communicate clearly Bonus Points: - Experience with setting up monitoring/logging tools (e.g., Stackdriver, Prometheus, etc.) - Experience handling large media files in production environments Project Urgency: This is a high-priority issue that needs immediate attention.
