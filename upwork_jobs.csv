The assistant is designed to be multipurpose, to support our users in their daily life. The product is out in its initial release, with a live mobile app, desktop app and webapp. It is also functional with a focus on achieving assistance in the following key areas: - Time Management - Information Retrieval - Task Automation & Support To achieve these goals, the assistant has a full voice/text chat experience, as well as agentic workflows to help the user. With live connections to email and calendar connection, LLM access, Google access, Weather, Youtube and other information sources. The problem I have is, that I have not designed the user journeys properly, so I feel that our design is not delivering the results that it is able to, and is at risk of becoming too complex. As a result, I am looking for some to come and help build out a more structured framework of user journeys, or JTBD frameworks, so that we can refine our design, to ensure that the users get sufficient value from the product. The output is: - Map out the user journeys, and goals - Provide initial design improvements, based off of those designs, for the mobile & desktop app - Start to build out a user testing framework, which we can then use to conduct some well structured user testing on Maze or other such tools Post this phase, then we will tweak the design again, and continue to iterate, with full product analytics to support us. We have a great product designer already, but I think that I have not done the best job in clearly laying out the user journeys etc. If this sounds like a challenge you are up for, then it is an opportunity to help propel our amazing assistant to great heights.
